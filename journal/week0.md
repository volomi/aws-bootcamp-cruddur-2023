I understood consignment very well including the services budgets , i was also able to draw lucid charts. Additionally i would like to add C4 and TOGAF are two different types of models used in the field of business and enterprise architecture.

C4 (Customers, Channels, Value Proposition, and Revenue Streams) is a simple business model framework that focuses on the four key components of a business. It is used to develop a clear understanding of a business' target customers, channels, value proposition, and revenue streams, and is typically used in the context of business strategy and planning.

TOGAF (The Open Group Architecture Framework) is an enterprise architecture framework that provides a comprehensive methodology and framework for designing, planning, implementing, and governing enterprise information systems and technology architectures. TOGAF provides a structured approach for defining an organization's current and future information and technology needs, and for aligning these needs with the overall business strategy.

In summary, C4 is focused on the business model of an organization, while TOGAF focuses on the enterprise architecture of an organization. Both models can be used together to provide a comprehensive view of an organization's strategy, operations, and technology.
